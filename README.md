# Harmful Content and Sentiment Analysis

  The purpose of this project is to understand text classification models and examine whether sentiment correlates with hate speech/offensive language labels. While hate speech and offensive language are often assumed to carry negative connotations, this project investigates whether that assumption holds true in the data. In addition to this, a simple web application was developed using Flask, allowing users to enter any text and receive both hate speech/offensive and sentiment labels for it.
